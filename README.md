Description:

**Who is the code for?**

This app is mainly used for entertainment for someone who is bored or has nothing to do. It's like one of those random "What is your Disney Princess?" kind of tests.

**What the program does?/What does it automate?**

This program is a unique app that correlates a connection between your specific emotions and a drink. Your drink will be based on your personality, emotion-type, and character traits. It will ask 3 questions to the user in order to determine what drink they correlate with the most. It has a backend of a AI API which is able to generate essentially an infinite number of drinks that your emotions can connect with.
